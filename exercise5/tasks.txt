Task 2

1.
a) No work is needed

b) No work is needed

c) NOT A OR B OR C

d) (NOT A AND C) OR B

2.
The statements in KB on CNF is:
    
    ((NOT c OR NOT a) AND (NOT c OR B))
    NOT d OR NOT e OR C
    a AND d

Since the last statement says that both a and d are true,
it follows in the first part of the first statement that
NOT c must be true, thus making c false. With this, we can
conclude that NOT e is in KB, making KB AND e unsatisfiable,
and we have shown that KB entails NOT e.

Task 3

1
a) Occupation(Emily, Surgeon) ∨ Occupation(Emily, Lawyer)

c) ∀x Surgeon(x) ⇒ Doctor(x)

g) ∀x ∃y Surgeon(x) ⇒ Lawyer(y)

2
Using equality to show that a value has a property can be misinterpreted as that it has been assigned to that property. In this example, writing WA = red may lead people to infer that WA is red, and not giving the correct meaning of our statement.
